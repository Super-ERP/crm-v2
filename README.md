## CRM sales lifecycle

- Shared lists support private per-member saved views: typed filters, sorting,
  visible columns, page size, rename/duplicate/default/delete, and base-view
  reset. There are no organization-shared views.
- Accounts require a Settings-configured ISO currency. Leads omit Funnel/Stage;
  conversion uses the default Sales Funnel and first open 0E stage.
- Opportunities use generated ORGCODEOPP-YYYY-NNNN code/name values. PPVVC is
  authoritative on the Opportunity in Power Sponsor, Pain, Vision, Value,
  Control order and synchronizes live child Funnels. Project code is allocated once,
  on first entry to 4A; no Project record is created by that transition.
- Funnel rollback is allowed to nonterminal stages without gates; forward
  movement revalidates requirements. Closed Won and Closed Lost are terminal.
- Quotations copy Settings Notes, Delivery, Payment Term, and recipient-scoped
  Attention snapshots. Lifecycle is Draft → Pending Approval → Approved →
  Sent; approval requires quotation.approve. Revisions copy the source into
  Draft and preserve the source. Customer acceptance never changes Funnel
  stage.
- Payment Milestones are planning records: Won → Invoiced only. Closed Won
  marks live milestones Won; users mark them Invoiced. They do not create
  invoices or complete Projects.

## Lifecycle migration and maintenance

Apply migrations 0076 through 0083 in journal order: saved views, Account
currency, Opportunity naming/project-code timing, Product taxonomy and quote
defaults, quotation content, approval, revisions, then milestone decoupling.
Deploy also reapplies RLS/views and permission synchronization. Preserve legacy
pipeline and finance history.

Rollback is application-level: stop new writes, deploy the compatible prior
application, keep additive columns and deprecated compatibility fields readable,
then resume with the forward migration sequence. Direct destructive SQL
rollback is unsupported. Before release, run the web tests, lint, typecheck,
build, migration-journal checks, and tenant-safe smoke tests for Account,
conversion, PPVVC, quotations, stage rollback, and milestones.

The app itself lives in `apps/web` (a pnpm workspace under the repo root). Local-dev
and CI commands run from the repo **root** — the root `package.json` scripts
delegate to `--filter web`, so you don't need to `cd apps/web`.

## Local development
```bash
cp .env.example .env            # sensible localhost defaults; Microsoft optional for email login
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d   # local Postgres 17 on :5432 (matches .env.example)
pnpm install
pnpm run db:generate             # (already generated; re-run after schema changes)
pnpm run db:setup                # apply migrations + RLS + views, then seed
pnpm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```
> `docker-compose.dev.yaml` runs **only** Postgres for local dev; the app itself runs on the host via `pnpm run dev`. If you already have a Postgres 17 elsewhere, point `DATABASE_URL` (the RLS-enforced `crm_app` role) and `DATABASE_ADMIN_URL` (the superuser, for migrations + seed) at it instead. `crm_app` is created by `db:setup`.
The seed creates a **Demo Entity** and a demo Owner login (printed at the end, default `admin@demo.local` / `Password123!`).

To start with a populated demo (extra logins + sample customers/funnels/quotations) instead of an empty entity, use the seeded setup — same as `db:setup`, plus `db/seed-sample.ts` layered on top:
```bash
pnpm run db:setup-seeded         # migrations + RLS + views + base seed + sample data
```
This adds four more logins under the Demo Entity (all password `Password123!`) and a set of sample customers, contacts, funnels, quotations, a won project, and leads to play with:

| Email | Role | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin@demo.local` | Owner (superadmin) | 100 |
| `manager@demo.local` | Manager | 60 |
| `sales1@demo.local` | Rep | 20 |
| `sales2@demo.local` | Rep | 20 |
| `viewer@demo.local` | Viewer | 10 |

The sample seed is idempotent and **dev-only** — don't run it on an internet-exposed deployment (it mints well-known default credentials). It is intentionally not part of the production Docker `migrate` step.

## Signed client release images

Client releases come from annotated strict SemVer tags such as `v1.2.3`.
`.github/workflows/release-images.yml` builds Linux AMD64 images for
the web runtime, migrator, encrypted-backup runtime, and deployment agent on GitHub-hosted
runners. It pushes each build by immutable digest first, blocks on High or
Critical Trivy findings, creates an SPDX JSON SBOM and maximum-mode BuildKit
provenance, then signs and verifies the digest with GitHub OIDC and Cosign.
Only verified digests receive the version and source-commit tags.

The workflow publishes a `release-manifest-<tag>` artifact containing each
GHCR repository and digest, source commit, workflow signing identity, and build
time. All four client image values must come from that manifest and retain the
`ghcr.io/...@sha256:...` form. Tags are discovery labels, never deployment
coordinates. The source-free bundle under `deploy/client/` verifies the exact
workflow identity before pulling any image.

For audits, the authoritative release-history file is maintained in:

```text
docs/operations/release-log.md
```

## Production

Production uses the pull-only, Cosign-verified bundle in `deploy/client/`.
Follow the [client deployment runbook](https://github.com/Q-App/docs/blob/main/archive/operations/deploy-client-README.md); do not build the
source Compose stack on a client production host.

## Operator workspace

Vendor operators onboard and maintain client deployments in the protected
control-plane UI. Create the client, current contract, and deployment; open the
deployment workspace; issue its one-time install token; then register, configure,
review, sign, and verify its heartbeat. Use the same workspace to issue a new
immutable signed version after a contract, configuration, or approved-release
change. See [operator onboarding, signing, and recovery](https://github.com/Q-App/docs/blob/main/archive/operations/OPERATIONS.md#operator-workspace-client-onboarding-and-signing).

This is an operator workflow, not a customer or integration-partner interface.
No documentation update records a live deployment or signed release; only
completed `release-images` runs append to the [release log](./docs/operations/release-log.md).

## Upgrade notes

The following are **intentional** behavior changes from this hardening pass. Operators
upgrading an existing deployment should review them before applying migrations.

- **Existing tenants are not locked out of password login.** Migration `0015` backfills
  `tenant_settings.allow_password_login = true` for every tenant that still had the old
  default of `false`, now that the flag is actually enforced at sign-in. SSO-only stays
  opt-in: a tenant can turn password login back off afterward.
- **`MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID` must be a real directory GUID.** The multi-tenant value
  `common` is no longer accepted (single-tenant hardening); in production the app refuses
  to boot if Entra is configured with `common`. Set your Entra directory (tenant) GUID.
- **The Entra redirect URI changed.** It is now
  `${BETTER_AUTH_URL}/api/auth/oauth2/callback/microsoft-entra-id`; the old `/callback/`
  rewrite was removed. **Re-register this exact URI in the Azure app registration** or
  sign-in will fail.
- **Exactly one superadmin is allowed.** A partial unique index permits a single
  superadmin row. **Before applying migration `0012`, demote any extra superadmins**, or
  the migration will fail. For break-glass, use direct DB access to flip the flag.

## Architecture notes
- **Data access** flows through `withTenant(permission, (tx, ctx) => …)` (`lib/actions.ts`), which authorizes then opens a tenant-scoped transaction.
- **Business rules** live in `server/services/*` (stage/approval state machine, quotation math, lead conversion) — no `next/*` imports, reusable beyond the web layer.
- Middleware (`proxy.ts`) is optimistic-redirect only; real auth is enforced in every Server Action / Route Handler.
