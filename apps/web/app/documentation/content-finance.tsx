        Concurrency-safe by construction: the status update is compare-and-set
        (a second concurrent click fails loudly), and number minting retries
        inside savepoints.
      </Callout>

      <H2>Payment Milestones are separate</H2>
      <P>
        Payment Milestones are planning records with three statuses:{" "}
        <B>Planned</B>, <B>Won</B> and <B>Invoiced</B>. They are Planned before a Funnel
        closes; <B>Closed Won</B> marks planned milestones Won, and a user
        manually changes Won to Invoiced. Payment Milestones do not create or
        update invoices or receipts and never complete a Project automatically.
        Finance documents are created and managed through their own Finance
        flows.
      </P>

      <H2>Reminders (in-app)</H2>
      <P>
        Issued invoices past due surface on the dashboard with “N d overdue”
        and “Reminder N due” chips computed from the{" "}
        <Code>invoice_reminder_days</Code> schedule (default 7/14/30 days
        after due). “Log reminder” increments the stage and stamps the
        activity trail — the schedule is fully editable in Settings →
        Numbering.
      </P>

      <H2>Module entitlement</H2>
      <P>
        Finance access comes from the deployment&apos;s signed runtime entitlement.
        Finance depends on <Code>projects</Code> and <Code>salesOrders</Code>;
        incomplete signed bundles are rejected before activation.
      </P>

      <H3>Is entitlement removal safe in production?</H3>
      <P>
        <B>Yes — entitlement only gates access, never data.</B> What removal does,
        concretely:
      </P>
      <Ul>
        <Li>
          Nav section disappears; <Code>/billing</Code>,{" "}
          <Code>/purchasing</Code> and every document detail page redirect to
          the dashboard.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          Every finance server action re-checks the flag and refuses — no
          writes can happen while off. Attachments/activity on finance
          documents are refused too.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          Derived surfaces vanish cleanly: the project Billing tab, dashboard
          overdue-invoices card, forecast billed-margin card and the two
          finance Behavior switches in Settings all hide (each checks the flag
          server-side).
        </Li>
        <Li>
          The intercompany auto-mirror never writes into a tenant whose flag
          is off — the pair is skipped with a visible activity note on the
          origin invoice.
        </Li>
      </Ul>
      <P>
        <B>Nothing is deleted or mutated by toggling.</B> All documents,
        attachments, reminder counters and Payment Milestone records are retained;
        toggling back ON shows everything exactly as it was. Numbering
        continues where it left off (count-based, and documents are never
        hard-deleted). Payment Milestone status is managed independently of
        the Finance entitlement.
      </P>
      <Callout tone="warn">
        The only irreversible action in the module is business-level, not
        toggle-level: issued documents are real financial records. Toggling
        OFF mid-month simply freezes the chains; it does not un-issue
        anything.

    <>
      <Lead>
        An intercompany deal is one the selling entity contracts but a sibling
        entity delivers. The seller recognizes its cut (
        <Code>recognized_percent</Code>); the remainder is the{" "}
        <B>partner share</B>. The deal’s account stays the end customer — the
        partner link is an <B>entity</B> link, validated against the tenant’s
        partner allow-list.
      </Lead>

      <H2>The mirror</H2>
      <P>
        <Code>intercompany_deals</Code> is a read-only snapshot row per interco
        deal, visible to <B>both</B> tenants via a custom two-sided RLS policy
        (origin writes, partner reads). It carries name, customer name,
        amounts, stage probability and forecast eligibility — so the partner
        needs no access to the origin’s protected tables. It is upserted on
        every relevant funnel mutation and reconciled on deploy.

      <H2>The handshake</H2>
      <P>
        The partner sees inbound deals on <Code>/intercompany</Code> and

        <Code>intercompany_deal_responses</Code>, shown as a badge on the
        origin’s funnel page. A partner can create its own{" "}
        <B>delivery project</B> from an accepted inbound deal (value prefilled
        to the share, linked via <Code>projects.intercompany_deal_id</Code>).

          <B>Origin:</B> forecast rows expose recognized-weighted value
