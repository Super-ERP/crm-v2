      <H2>Sales orders</H2>

        A sales order is the project’s internal approval to bill:{" "}

        picklists) → a holder of <Code>sales_order.approve</Code> approves or
        rejects with a reason. The SO number is minted on approval, and an{" "}

        <Li>
          Project status is managed independently of Payment Milestones; a

          Finance invoices and receipts follow the separate Finance lifecycle
          and do not depend on Payment Milestones (see{" "}
